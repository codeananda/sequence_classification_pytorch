# PyTorch - Time-Series / Sequence Multiclass Classification ‚åõ

This repo contains a write-up for the first stage of a paid project I completed for a client on Upwork. At the time of writing, we are waiting to start stage 2 and as such the client has not left any feedback yet. But here is a screenshot of the number of hours worked so far.

It currently contains:
1. `electrochem_pytorch` - a sequence/time-series modelling project completed for an Upwork client. The task: build a module in PyTorch to classify sequences into one of four categories. It achieved 97% accuracy.

This portfolio is a work in progress. It probably won't be in perfect condition when you read it. But I hope it gives you an idea of the quality of my work and what I can do. Also, if you're really interested, you can go through every commit to see exactly how I created each project!

If you are interested in working together, please reach out via my [Upwork profile](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01153ca9fd0099730e) or email me at: adamdmurphy4 [at] gmail [dot] com
