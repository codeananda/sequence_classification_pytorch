# Welcome to Adam Murphy's Portfolio ðŸ‘‹

This repo contains write ups of either paid projects I have done for clients or personal projects done for professional development.

It currently contains:
1. `electrochem_pytorch` - this is a sequence/time-series modelling project completed for a client on Upwork. The task was to build a module in PyTorch to classify sequences into one of four categories. We achieved 97% accuracy. 

This portfolio is a work in progress, so it may not be in 100% perfect condition when you read it. But I hope it gives you an idea of the quality of my work and what I can do.
