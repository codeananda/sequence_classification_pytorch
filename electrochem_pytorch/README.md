# PyTorch Sequence Classifier - XX% Accuracy

For this project, I worked with a client on Upwork alongside my mentor Waylon Flynn (LINK?).

As of writing we have billed 64 hours at $100/hour.

This demonstrates my abilities in:
- Teamwork
- PyTorch (specifically PyTorch Lightning)
- Sequence modelling and classification
